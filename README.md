# Decentralized Banking Loan Processing Automation

A comprehensive smart contract system built on Stacks blockchain using Clarity for automating banking loan processes in a decentralized manner.

## Overview

This system provides a complete loan processing pipeline from application submission to loan servicing, with automated underwriting and approval workflows. All processes are managed through smart contracts ensuring transparency, immutability, and decentralization.

## Architecture

The system consists of five main smart contracts:

### 1. Loan Officer Verification Contract (`loan-officer-verification.clar`)
- Manages verification and authorization of banking loan officers
- Maintains officer credentials and licensing information
- Controls access to loan processing functions

### 2. Application Processing Contract (`application-processing.clar`)
- Handles loan application submissions
- Manages application status tracking
- Provides interface for loan officers to review applications

### 3. Underwriting Automation Contract (`underwriting-automation.clar`)
- Automates loan underwriting decisions
- Calculates risk levels based on predefined criteria
- Provides debt-to-income ratio calculations
- Makes approval recommendations

### 4. Approval Workflow Contract (`approval-workflow.clar`)
- Manages loan approval process states
- Enforces proper workflow transitions
- Tracks approver information and decisions
- Handles loan approvals and rejections

### 5. Servicing Coordination Contract (`servicing-coordination.clar`)
- Coordinates loan servicing activities
- Tracks payment history and schedules
- Manages loan status throughout lifecycle
- Handles payment processing and balance updates

## Key Features

- **Automated Underwriting**: Uses predefined criteria for consistent loan evaluation
- **Workflow Management**: Enforces proper approval processes
- **Officer Verification**: Ensures only authorized personnel can process loans
- **Payment Tracking**: Comprehensive loan servicing capabilities
- **Transparency**: All decisions and processes recorded on blockchain
- **Immutability**: Loan records cannot be tampered with

## Underwriting Criteria

The automated underwriting system uses the following criteria:

- **Minimum Credit Score**: 650
- **Maximum Debt-to-Income Ratio**: 40%
- **Minimum Annual Income**: $30,000

### Risk Levels

- **Low Risk**: Credit score ≥ 750, DTI ≤ 25%, Income ≥ $75,000
- **Medium Risk**: Credit score ≥ 650, DTI ≤ 35%, Income ≥ $50,000
- **High Risk**: All other applications

## Usage

### For Loan Officers

1. **Get Verified**: Contract owner must verify your principal address
2. **Process Applications**: Review and update application statuses
3. **Create Workflows**: Initialize approval workflows for applications
4. **Make Decisions**: Approve or reject loans with reasons
5. **Originate Loans**: Create active loan records for approved applications

### For Borrowers

1. **Submit Application**: Provide required financial information
2. **Track Status**: Monitor application progress through the system
3. **Make Payments**: Process loan payments once approved

### For Administrators

1. **Verify Officers**: Add and manage loan officer credentials
2. **Monitor System**: Track overall loan portfolio performance
3. **Update Criteria**: Modify underwriting parameters as needed

## Contract Interactions

The contracts are designed to work together:

\`\`\`
Application → Underwriting → Workflow → Servicing
↑              ↑           ↑          ↑
└── Officer Verification (required for all operations)
\`\`\`

## Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only verified officers can process loans
- **State Validation**: Proper workflow state transitions enforced
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before processing
- **Immutable Records**: All loan decisions permanently recorded

## Deployment

1. Deploy contracts in the following order:
    - `loan-officer-verification.clar`
    - `application-processing.clar`
    - `underwriting-automation.clar`
    - `approval-workflow.clar`
    - `servicing-coordination.clar`

2. Verify initial loan officers through the verification contract

3. Configure underwriting criteria if different from defaults

## Testing

Run the test suite using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

Tests cover all major contract functions and edge cases.
